# Freed Leaderboard
The best leaderboard app for family game night!

Display the leaderboard on the Apple TV while controlling it from your iPhone.

Designed with the game Freed (a mixture of Greed and Farkle) in mind. However, this can be adapted to work with just about any multiplayer turn-based scoring game.

## Installation
1. Download the project files and open in XCode.
2. Run the "Freed-Leaderboard" target on your iPhone
3. Run the "Freed-Leaderboard-TV" target on your Apple TV
4. Open the app on each respective device (both must be connected to the same network).

## Usage
The Apple TV app, once launched really doesn't have to be touched. You can click on each player to see their score history, but other than that, the TV is designed to give players a quick glance view of where on the leaderboard they are.

The iPhone app is where all the magic happens.
- Start by inputting players in order. Players can easily be rearranged using the "Edit" button on the players screen.
- Then, you can connect to an Apple TV running the app with the TV button in the top right corner.
- From there, score each player each turn and watch the TV update almost instantly.

## Contributors
Shoutout to my dad for coming up with the original idea for the app, as well as creating the rules for the game itself, Freed.

Noah also put a lot of work into this, especially handling the scoring data and creating most of the UI/UX.

## Project Status
This project was primarily created for the purpose of playing Freed with the family at our family reunion in January 2026.

Further development may happen, although at a much slower pace as neither of us currently have an Apple Developer account to publish it, nor do either of us plan to soon.
